## Healthcare Management Sysytem

- <h4>A healthcare website that provides a smooth and efficient channel for patients to register themselves,        book appointments with doctors and access other basic medical services.</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The implementation of HMS in our IITG Hospital will enable it to make decisions
about the way theyâ€™re run, and<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the work they perform which will in turn help us treat
patients in a better way, access their real-time reports, and <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp other information, their
past clinical data and more can be done quickly which will lead to best patient
outcomes.</p>

- <h4>Captured the requirement analysis using ER Diagram to convert it into suitable relations with keys and constraints.</h4>
