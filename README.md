# Healthcare Management System
- __A healthcare website that provides a smooth and efficient channel for patients to register themselves, book appointments with doctors and access other basic medical services.__
  The implementation of HMS in our IITG Hospital will enable it to make decisions about the way theyâ€™re run, and
  the work they perform which will in turn help us treat patients in a better way, access their real-time reports, and
  other information, their past clinical data and more can be done quickly which will lead to best patient outcomes.
